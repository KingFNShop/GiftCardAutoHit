i just changed my tag

also this isnt dualhooked. it's open sourced and you can look through the sources of all website in the files.


Instructions
1. Change Webhook in index.js and save
2. This is optional but I recommend you to obfuscate style.css and index.js so the victim doesn't see the source code (There are free js and css obfuscators online)
3. Save and then make a website. (You can use https://000webhost.com if you need a free website)
4. Goto file manager and upload index.js and index.html and style.css (Don't upload the README.txt)
5. Save and now send the link to your victim and see if they fall for it.

also dont change the names of the file or else it wont work properly

this doesnt snipe giftcard codes, it just for cookie phishing

also if one of the image source all of a sudden turns invalid/doesnt appear just replace with a new image url
