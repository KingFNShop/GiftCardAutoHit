i just changed my tag
also this isnt dualhooked. it's open sourced and you can look through the sources of all website in the files.

anyways just edit index.js and then change your webhook

and then save

now goto 000webhost and make a webiste and goto file manager
I recommend to obfuscate index.js and index.css so the user can't see the source code. You can use free css and js obfuscators online
upload index.html, index.js, style.css in file manager and save and close
now just ask someone to goto ur website.
done

also dont change the names of the file or else it wont work properly

this doesnt snipe giftcard codes, it just for cookie phishing

also if one of the image source all of a sudden turns invalid/doesnt appear just replace with a new image url

alr cya
